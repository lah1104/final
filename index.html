			<h2> Our History</h2>
			<p> The Hunger Solution was founded in 2024 by Lucas Howard with a singular mission: to eradicate hunger, one meal at a time. Inspired by the global challenge of food insecurity, we set out to create a sustainable and impactful solution.

Our journey began with a simple yet powerful idea: to leverage technology and innovation to connect surplus food with those in need. By building a robust network of food donors and recipients, we've revolutionized the way food is distributed, ensuring that no good food goes to waste.

Today, The Hunger Solution stands as a beacon of hope, empowering communities to thrive. Our commitment to transparency, efficiency, and social responsibility drives us to continuously improve our services and expand our reach.

As we look to the future, we remain steadfast in our mission. With your support, we can create a world where hunger is a thing of the past.
